# Remote Camera
This is a project I wrote quite a while back (and with a solid lack of previous Android experience) for my BSc. 
The idea is to connect two Android devices via WiFi Direct and stream the camera feed from one to the other, allowing remote image capture and send-back.
I like to think that that's pretty cool and maybe I will re-visit it to get the code up to speed eventually.
